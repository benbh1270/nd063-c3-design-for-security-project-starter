1) AWS GuardDuty did not seem to pickup any events from the Hydra 
attack generated from the attack instance when I ran it (and I ran it twice, once
after completely blowing away the infrastructure and recreating it).  This issue 
has been seen in the Mentor Chat by others.  I also allowed the Hydra program to run
for a couple hours, but it does look like the session was terminiated in the middle of
the night and there were no findings in GuardDuty in the morning.  Hypothetically,
GuardDuty should have identified the excessive failed SSH logins going to the application
server EC2 instance.

3) AWS GuardDuty acquires events from several sources including AWS CloudTrail Event Logs, AWS CloudTrail Management Events, AWS CloudTrail S3 Data Events,
VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.  This attack scenario (should have) targted trying to log on to a vulnerable EC2 instance with SSH open to the internet using
a rainbow table (rockyou.txt) of passwords using hydra, which uses multiple similutanous threads to brute force the SSH endpoint login.  Most likely, you would 
see this attack via the VPC Flow Logs which capture IP traffic going back and forth between the EC2 instance and the VPC.  GuardDuty theoretically would see an 
abnormal amount traffic going to the SSH Port (22) and raise a finding for it.
