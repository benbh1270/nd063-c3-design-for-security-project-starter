I) AWS Config Findings
    1. Issues
        a)  All 3 (both recipe buckets and the flow log bucket) of the created S3 Buckets have identified compliance issues.  They have server-side encryption disabled,
            leaving the data vulnerable.   They also have logging disabled.

            Remediation:
            Enable default encryption and logging on the S3 buckets.
        
        b)  The EC2 instance EBS volume is not encrypted.
            
            Remediation:
            Enable the encryption on the EBS volumes.

II) Inspector
    1. Issues
        a) The Web Application EC2 Instance has (unneeded) open ports which are generally used to support FTP and Telnet, both of which are tools commonly
            used by malicious actors to compromise systems and exfiltrate data.

            Remediation:
            Close unnecessary ports on the EC2 instance secuirty group.

III) Security Hub
    1. Issues
        a) Root user does not have MFA enabled.

            Remediation:
            Enable MFA for root user to provide additional proctection against compromised passwords/keys of critical accounts.
        
        b) S3 Buckets have not blocked public access.

            Remediation:
            Block public access to S3 buckets.
