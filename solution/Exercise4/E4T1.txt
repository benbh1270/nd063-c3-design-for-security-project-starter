Looking at the attacks generated in the Exercise 3, there are two main issues with the current configuration that would need to be remediated.
1) SSH Open on the EC2 Application Server instance
    There is not a good reason to keep SSH (port 22) open.  In most cases, your architecture should be configured in such way using IaaS patterns
    and deployment pipelines, that any environment changes should be created via releasing new infrastructure via Infrastructure as Code.  Therefore.
    blocking SSH (and various other unnecessary ports that are open) would prevent the hydra brute force attach.  Even more securely, security groups 
    could be setup to only allow traffic to the EC2 instance from the Application Load Balancer, as there was no specified need to get to the EC2 instance.

2) S3 Bucket Security
    The was no specified reason for the "secret" S3 Bucket to be availabel from the VPC area where the attack instance was located.  Also, additional security
    via IAM Roles could restrict who has access to the S3 bucket, which would have stopped a non-privileged account via the attack instance from getting access to
    the files stored in the secret S3 bucket.  Also, enabling encryption would have protected the data contained within the file even if it could have been retrieved from 
    the bucket.
