1) There are several additional architectural changes that could be made to reduce the threat of an internet-facing attack.  Ome, you could move the web 
application EC2 isntance to a private subnet, this would make it more difficult for an internet-facing attacker to access the instance.  Web Application Firewalls 
(WAF) could be added to the environment to protect against additional internet-facing attacks.

2) This would not secure the secret S3 bucket as the private VPC wouldn't stop any users who had access to the environment from being able to access files and 
the secret S3 bucket was suppose to be accessible to only a small subset of users.

3) Applying default encryption to an S3 Bucket after-the-fact will not encrypt any files that have already been stored in the S3 Bucket prior to the change.  They
will remain unencrypted.  There are batch processes that can be done within AWS/S3 to apply the encryption to the existing files, but that is a seperate activity 
to applying the encryption settings to the S3 bucket.

4) If the original CloudFormation templates were to be applied again after having made changes via SSH and/or the console, all the changes would be lost.  The 
CloudFormation templates deploy the AWS components as described and potentially revert them back to the originally configured state.  The changes between the CloudFormation
templates and the current environment configuration is "Drift".
